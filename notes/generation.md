How do you generate a maze ?
Algorithms that are used in maze generation
- Prim's Algorithm	
- Recursive Backtracking (DFS)
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Growing Tree
- Eller's Algorithm

## Metrics measured during generation
- number of decision points: Nodes with more than one child
- dead ends: Nodes with degree one
- longest path: Use BFS to compute graph diameter
- avergage path length: Mean distance from entrance to all other cells

#### Mathematical Concepts to Research:
- Graph traversal and spanning trees
- Union-Find data structure and path compression
- Randomized algorithms and entropy
- Probabilistic analysis of maze connectivity
- Diameter and radius of graphsw
- Average-case vs worst-case path lengths
- Graph entropy and complexity
- Topological properties of random mazes
