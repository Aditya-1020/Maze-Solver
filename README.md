# Maze-Solver
Building a maze generator and solver using SDL in C.
Objective: visually render mazes and their solutions but also analyze using metrics.

## Future Extensions

- Maze Topology Experiments: Wrap-around mazes (like a torus), or mazes with multiple entrances and exits.
- 3D Mazes: Use SDL to render in pseudo-3D; extends graph model to 3D grids.
- Markov Decision Processes: Model maze solving as reinforcement learning.
- Fractal Mazes: Recursive maze generation; tie-in with **self-similar structures**.
- Information Theory Metrics: Entropy of maze layouts, Kolmogorov complexity.
- Cellular Automata as Maze Generators
